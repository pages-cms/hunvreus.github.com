Oh yeah, one full year! One year without the slightest change on this website; no blog post, no comment (except for ads for blue pills and other libido enhancers), no nothing. And you know what? I don't feel ashamed at all.

The truth is that I have been working like hell, 6 to 7 days a week, even on holidays, and I hope it was worth it. When you have spent the whole day building websites for other you don't especially feel the need to do the same for yourself. But I am still alive and I am ready to finally use this website for its original purpose: post my pictures and projects, and maybe geek big time. Who knows, I may be able to post more than once a month.

Anyway, in the next few weeks you will see a lot being posted in the [work](/work) section of this website as I gradually clean and document several of my projects. Some of these are Drupal modules and should be on the official CVS pretty soon.

Stay tuned, this time I won't mysteriously disappear in a parallel universe.
